Done. Next step depends on your session:
  X11 (you are on X11):  Alt+F2, type 'r', Enter   (reloads the shell in place)
  Wayland:               log out and back in

Then verify it is active:
  gnome-extensions info ${UUID}

Watch for errors while testing:
  journalctl -f -o cat /usr/bin/gnome-shell
